=========

1.3.0 release 2018-08-18
------------------------

This release renames class Activity to Track, and it renames Track.what
to Track.category. The latter means that .gpx files should be adjusted:
where the keywords now contain "What:", change that to "Category:".

  * new: Track.last_point() avoids having to iterate over the full list
  * new: gpxdo diff
  * gpxdo: bash completion if argcomplete is installed (pip install argcomplete).
    Put this into your .bashrc: eval "$(register-python-argcomplete gpxdo)"
    or see https://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  * new in Track: speed(), moving_speed(), warnings()
  * gpxdo --long shows warnings about strange tracks
  * gpxdo --total
  * gpxdo set --help shows all legal categories
  * gpxdo ls: if no file/directory given, use "."
  * gpxdo: unify how backends/tracks are displayed. Remove leading "./" from names.
  * gpxdo --debug shows backtrace for errors
  * Backend.merge() now also accepts a single Track
  * Backend.diff() now accepts an Track, a Backend or a list of any of them on for both sides
  * GPSIES: workaround for sporadic bug in editTrack
  * Track.clone() does not pass id_in_backend anymore
  * Backend.scan() tries to keep known tracks
  * Backend.diff() now compares all attributes
  * new: Track.identifier() and Backend.identifier() and use them for better output in gpxdo
  * new: gpxdo set for setting/clearing any attributes
  * Track.add_keyword(): given a duplicate, silently ignore it
  * gpxdo kw now accepts a list of comma separated keywords
  * gpxdo: filter by keywords: --only-kw
  * gpxdo --last-date now includes that date
  * gpxdo --first-date and --last-date now also accept YYYY-MM and YYYY
  * gpxdo --date is new: specific date YYYY, YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD
  * gpxdo --set --id-from-title is new
  * gpxdo --set --id-from-time is new
  * gpxdo --similar
  * new: Track.similarity(other)
  * gpxity now uses the python logging module for all output
  * gpxdo: replace --debug and --verbose by --loglevel
  * new backend Mailer
  * new: class Lifetrack
  * new: bin/gpxity_server. This is unfinished work, it is intended as a server for
    lifetracking.
