class Backend:

    """A place where tracks live. Something like the filesystem or http://mapmytracks.com.

    A Backend should hold only tracks for one person, and they
    should not overlap in time. This is not enforced but sometimes
    behaviour is undefined if you ignore this.

    A Backend be used as a context manager. Upon termination, all tracks
    may be removed automatically by setting cleanup=True. Some concrete
    implementations may also remove the backend itself.

    A Backend allows indexing by normal int index, by :class:`Track <gpxity.track.Track>`
    and by :attr:`Track.id_in_backend <gpxity.track.Track.id_in_backend>`.
    :literal:`if 'ident' in backend` is possible.
    len(backend) shows the number of tracks. Please note that Code
    like :literal:`if backend:` may not behave as expected. This will be False if the backend
    has no track. If that is not what you want, consider :literal:`if backend is not None`

    The backend will automatically synchronize. So something like :literal:`len(Backend())` will work.
    However, some other Backend pointing to the same storage or even a different process
    might change things. If you want to cope with that, use :meth:`scan`.

    Not all backends support all methods. The unsupported methods
    will raise NotImplementedError. As a convenience every backend
    has a list **supported** to be used like :literal:`if 'track' in backend.supported:`
    where `track` is the name of the method.

    Backends support no locking. If others modify a backend concurrently, you may
    get surprises. It is up to you to handle those.

    Some backends may use cookies.

    Args:
        url (str): Initial value for :attr:`url`
        auth (str):  The username.
            This will lookup the password and config from :class:`Authenticate <gpxity.auth.Authenticate>`.
            You can also pass a dict containing what would normally be obtained from
            :class:`Authenticate <gpxity.auth.Authenticate>`. The dict must also contain 'Username'.
        cleanup (bool): If true, :meth:`destroy` will remove all tracks.

    Attributes:
        supported (set(str)): The names of supported methods. Creating the first instance of
            the backend initializes this. Only methods which may not be supported are mentioned here.
            If a particular value write_* like write_public does not exist, the entire track is written instead
            which normally results in a new ident for the track.
        full_support (set(str)): All possible values for the supported attribute.
        url (str): the address. May be a real URL or a directory, depending on the backend implementation.
            Every implementation may define its own default for url. Must never end with '/' except for
            Directory(url='/').
        timeout: If None, there are no timeouts: Gpxity waits forever. For legal values
            see http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#timeouts
        fences: The fences as found in config. You can programmatically change them but they will
            never be applied to already existing data.
        needs_config: If True, the Backend class expects data in auth.cfg
        config: A Section with all entries in auth.cfg for this backend
        config.fences: The backend will never write points within fences.
            You can define any number of fences separated by spaces. Every fence is a circle.
            It has the form Lat/Long/meter.
            Lat and Long are the center position in decimal degrees, meter is the radius.
        test_is_expensive: For internal use. If True, the self tests will reduce test cases and try to
            avoid too much usage of the backend.
        max_field_sizes: Some backends have a limited size for some attributes like keywords. This
            is only an approximative guess. The backend will not protect you from overriding it
            but the unittests will try to stay within those limits.
        point_precision: The precision supported by this backend. We are never more precise than 6.
            That is the digits after the decimal separator.
