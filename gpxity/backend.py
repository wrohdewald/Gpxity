class Backend:
    """A place where activities live. Something like the filesystem or
    http://mapmytracks.com.

    A Backend should hold only activities for one person, and they
    should not overlap in time. This is not enforced but sometimes
    behaviour is undefined if you ignore this.

    This can be used as a context manager. At termination, all activities
    may be removed automatically, if cleanup=True. Some concrete
    implementations may also remove the backend itself.

    A backend allows indexing by normal int index, by :class:`Activity <gpxity.Activity>`
    and by :attr:`Activity.id_in_backend <gpxity.Activity.id_in_backend>`.
    :literal:`if 'ident' in backend` is possible.
    len(backend) shows the number of activities. Please note that Code
    like :literal:`if backend:` may not behave as expected. This will be False if the backend
    has no activity. If that is not what you want, consider :literal:`if backend is not None`

    The backend will automatically synchronize. So something like :literal:`len(Backend())` will work.
    However, some other Backend pointing to the same storage or even a different process
    might change things. If you want to cope with that, use :meth:`scan`.

    Not all backends support all methods. The unsupported methods
    will raise NotImplementedError. As a convenience every backend
    has a list **supported** to be used like :literal:`if 'track' in backend.supported:`
    where `track` is the name of the method.

    Backends support no locking. If others modify a backend concurrently, you may
    get surprises. It is up to you to handle those.

    Args:
        url (str): Initial value for :attr:`url`
        auth (tuple(str, str)): (username, password). Alternatively you can pass the username as a single string.
            This will lookup the password from :class:`Authenticate <gpxity.auth.Authenticate>`.
        cleanup (bool): If true, :meth:`destroy` will remove all activities.

    Attributes:
        supported (set(str)): The names of supported methods. Creating the first instance of
            the backend initializes this. Only methods which may not be supported are mentioned here.
            Those are: remove, track, get_time, _write_title, _write_public, _write_what,
            _write_gpx, _write_description, _write_keywords, _write_add_keyword, _write_remove_keyword.
            If a particular _write_* like _write_public does not exist, the entire activity is written instead.
        url (str): the address. May be a real URL or a directory, depending on the backend implementation.
            Every implementation may define its own default for url.
