class Backend:
    """A place where activities live. Something like the filesystem or
    http://mapmytracks.com.

    A Backend should hold only activities for one person, and they
    should not overlap in time. This is not enforced but sometimes
    behaviour is undefined if you ignore this.

    A Backend be used as a context manager. Upon termination, all activities
    may be removed automatically by setting cleanup=True. Some concrete
    implementations may also remove the backend itself.

    A Backend allows indexing by normal int index, by :class:`Activity <gpxity.Activity>`
    and by :attr:`Activity.id_in_backend <gpxity.Activity.id_in_backend>`.
    :literal:`if 'ident' in backend` is possible.
    len(backend) shows the number of activities. Please note that Code
    like :literal:`if backend:` may not behave as expected. This will be False if the backend
    has no activity. If that is not what you want, consider :literal:`if backend is not None`

    The backend will automatically synchronize. So something like :literal:`len(Backend())` will work.
    However, some other Backend pointing to the same storage or even a different process
    might change things. If you want to cope with that, use :meth:`scan`.

    Not all backends support all methods. The unsupported methods
    will raise NotImplementedError. As a convenience every backend
    has a list **supported** to be used like :literal:`if 'track' in backend.supported:`
    where `track` is the name of the method.

    Backends support no locking. If others modify a backend concurrently, you may
    get surprises. It is up to you to handle those.

    Some backends may use cookies.

    Args:
        url (str): Initial value for :attr:`url`
        auth (tuple(str, str)): (username, password). Alternatively you can pass the username as a single string.
            This will lookup the password from :class:`Authenticate <gpxity.auth.Authenticate>`.
        cleanup (bool): If true, :meth:`destroy` will remove all activities.

    Attributes:
        supported (set(str)): The names of supported methods. Creating the first instance of
            the backend initializes this. Only methods which may not be supported are mentioned here.
            Those are: remove, track, get_time, _write_title, _write_public, _write_what,
            _write_gpx, _write_description, _write_keywords, _write_add_keyword, _write_remove_keyword.
            If a particular _write_* like _write_public does not exist, the entire activity is written instead
            which normally results in a new ident for the activity.
        url (str): the address. May be a real URL or a directory, depending on the backend implementation.
            Every implementation may define its own default for url.
        debug: If True, print debugging information
        timeout: If None, there are no timeouts: Gpxity waits forever. For legal values
            see http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#timeouts
